              <h2>HOW DO GIFTS WORK?</h2>
              <p>
                You acquire Gifts by redeeming the Coin available in your
                account on the Platform. You can send these Gifts to other users
                as well as receive Gifts from other users on the Platform. Do
                note that Gifts sent or received by you cannot be exchanged for
                cash, or legal tender. When a user sends a gift to another user,
                the value of the gift received is shown in the recipient’s
                account in the form of Diamonds ("Diamonds"). Diamonds cannot be
                converted into Coins and vice versa. PixaliveFarms has the right
                to change the value of such Diamonds as per its discretion.
